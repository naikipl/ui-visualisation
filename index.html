			<h2>Africa</h2>
			<p>
				Sub-Saharan Africa clearly is in need of high levels of food security assistance, 
				ranking highest in the proportion of undernourished at the region, sub-region and 
				country levels from 1997-1999, and experiencing little improvement since 1990-1992, 
				and no improvement looking back to 1969-71.  Among its sub-regions, Central Africa 
				is the worst off, however some of the worst performing countries are also in East 
				and Southern Africa, as described above.  West Africa as a sub-region performs well, 
				but it does have several countries with undernourishment rates of over 40% 
				(Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone).

			<h2>India</h2>
			<p>
				Victoria is a state located in the south-eastern corner of Australia. It is the smallest mainland state in area but
				the most densely populated and urbanised. Prior to European settlement, some 30,000 Indigenous Australians lived in
				the area now occupied by the state. By contrast, over five million people now inhabit the region. European settlement
				in Victoria began in the 1830s as a farming community. Victoria is the second most populous Australian state, after New South Wales, with
				an estimated population of 5,205,200 as of June 2007. Melbourne is Victoria’s capital and largest city, with more
				than 70% of all Victorians living there.

			<h2>Uganda</h2>
			<p>
				The hunger situation in Uganda has generally improved over the last few years. 
				In the north, after more than two decades of fighting between the Lord’s Resistance 
				Army and Government forces, peace has returned and over 80 percent of Internally 
				Displaced Persons (IDPs) have moved back to their original homes and farms. 
				In the west, over 88 percent of the refugees from Sudan and other countries 
				have departed since 2006. And, in the northeast, the marginalized region of 
				Karamoja is receiving more political attention and assistance.
